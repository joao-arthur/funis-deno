 * # compose
 *
 * Returns a function that apply the result of each function to the next one in the opposite order they are defined.
 *
 * > Typescript does not infer the type of the function arguments as you would expect.
 * > You have to explicit type all but the first function argument 😰.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```ts
 * compose(
 *     value => `${value} is the result` // "5 is the result"
 *     (value: number) => value / 3, // 5
 *     (value: number) => value - 5, // 15
 *     (value: number) => value * 2, // 20
 * )(10) // "5 is the result"
 * ```

 * # pipe
 *
 * Returns a function that apply the result of each function to the next one in the order they are defined.
 *
 * > Typescript does not infer the type of the first function argument when you call the function.
 * > To ensure type-safety, you have to explicit type the first function.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```ts
 * pipe(
 *    (value: number) => value * 2, // 20
 *    value => value - 5, // 15
 *    value => value / 3, // 5
 *    value => `${value} is the result` // "5 is the result"
 * )(10) // "5 is the result"
 * ```
